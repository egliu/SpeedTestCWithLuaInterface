Client for SpeedTest.net infrastructure written in pure C99 standard using only POSIX libraries.

Main purpose for this project was to deliver client for Speedtest.net 
infrastructure for embedded devices.

All application is written in pure C99 standard (it should compile with C90
too), without using any external libraries - only POSIX is used.

Code is not perfect, and it has a few bugs, but it is stable and it works.

Big thanks for Luke Graham for his http function.

To compile, just type make.
